ZaneOps is a deployment platform that simplifies the process of managing and deploying web applications. This guide will walk you through the steps to install ZaneOps either locally or on a remote server with minimal configuration.

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
ZaneOps is currently in **alpha** and is not stable for production use. However, we encourage you to contribute by testing the platform locally, reporting bugs, and providing feedback to help improve it.

## Prerequesites

Ensure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed and are using a Unix-based machine. It's recommended to use the latest version of Docker to avoid compatibility issues.

## Process

<Steps>
1. **Create the installation directory**:

    Choose a directory for ZaneOps. This guide uses `/var/www/zaneops`:

    ```shell
    mkdir -p /var/www/zaneops 
    cd /var/www/zaneops
    ```

2. Download the makefile for the project :

    ```shell
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zane-ops/zane-ops/main/deploy.mk > Makefile
    ```

3. Launch the setup process :

    ```shell
    make setup
    ```

    After this step, your directory structure should look like this:

    <FileTree>

    - zaneops
        - .fluentd/
        - temporalio
            - config
                - development.yaml
            - entrypoint.sh
        - docker-stack.prod-http.yaml
        - docker-stack.prod.yaml
        - .env
        - Makefile

    </FileTree>

4. Update environment variables in `.env` :
    The setup process will generate sane defaults for environment variables, 
    but you can modify the contents to better suit your needs (see here for [how to customize](#environment-variables-explained)):
    
    ```shell
    # Example configuration - Modify before production use
    IMAGE_VERSION=canary # ZaneOps version to install
    ZANE_APP_DIRECTORY="/var/www/zaneops" # Installation directory for ZaneOps
    ZANE_DB_USER= # Generate with: "curl -s https://randomuser.me/api/ | jq -r '.results[0].login.username'"
    ZANE_DB_PASSWORD= # Generate with: "$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
    DJANGO_SECRET_KEY= # Generate with: "$(openssl rand -base64 64)"

    # ⚠️ Update if ZaneOps is not hosted locally ⚠️
    ROOT_DOMAIN="127-0-0-1.sslip.io" # Root domain for generating app domains
    ZANE_APP_DOMAIN="127-0-0-1.sslip.io" # Domain for ZaneOps dashboard
    ```

5. Deploy ZaneOps :

    ```shell
    make deploy
    ```

6. Create your first user to login to the dashboard :

    ```shell
    make create-user
    ```

7. Log in to the dashboard by connecting to the domain specified in `ZANE_APP_DOMAIN`. If hosted locally, you can use http://127-0-0-1.sslip.io.
</Steps>



### Environment Variables Explained

1. `IMAGE_VERSION`: Specifies the ZaneOps version to install.
2. `ZANE_APP_DIRECTORY`: Defines the directory where ZaneOps will be installed.
3. `ZANE_DB_USER` / `ZANE_DB_PASSWORD`: Credentials for connecting to the database.
4. `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`: Used by the API for various security functions, such as hashing user session tokens. Generate a secure key with at least 64 characters using a tool like [openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) (e.g., `openssl rand -base64 64`).
5. `ROOT_DOMAIN`: Used to generate subdomains for deployed web apps, e.g., `my-web-app.127-0-0-1.sslip.io`. The root domain itself can also host the dashboard if desired.
6. `ZANE_APP_DOMAIN`: The domain where the ZaneOps dashboard will be accessible after deployment. It can be the same as `ROOT_DOMAIN`

### Additional Commands

Use these commands for managing your ZaneOps installation:

```shell
# Shut down ZaneOps
make remove

# Delete ZaneOps and all its associated resources
make delete-resources
```

### Deploying Locally 

ZaneOps can be installed locally with minimal configuration changes. 
To do this, keep the `ZANE_APP_DOMAIN` and `ROOT_DOMAIN` environment variables set to http://127-0-0-1.sslip.io.
