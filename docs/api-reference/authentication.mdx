API request requires a `Bearer` token in `Authorization` header, which could be generated from the UI.

# Generate a Token

1. Go to `Keys & Tokens` / `API tokens`.
2. Define a name for your token and click `Create New Token`.

<Tip>
  You will see the token once, so make sure to copy it and store it in a safe
  place.
</Tip>

# Scope

The token will only be able to access resources that are owned by the team that the token is scoped to.

```php
# Sample token

```

# Permissions

Currently there are three types of permissions:

- read-only `(default)`
- view:sensitive
- `*` (all permissions)

## `read-only`

With this permission, you can only read data from the API, but you can't create, update, or delete any resources. Also you can't see sensitive data.

## `view:sensitive`

Without this permission, passwords, api keys, and other sensitive data will be redacted from the API response.

## `*`

Full access to all resources and sensitive data.
