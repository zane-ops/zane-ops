@{{dpl.pr_author}} attempted to deploy a pull request to the service [{{dpl.service_fqdn}}]({{dpl.service_url}}) on ZaneOps.

A member of the ZaneOps instance needs to [review and approve this deployment]({{dpl.approval_url}}) before it can run.

*This safeguard prevents untrusted code from running in preview environments. Only verified team members can approve and trigger these deployments.*

<summary>üõ°Ô∏è Why this protection matters</summary>

Without this check, unauthorized users could:
- Run harmful code on the preview server  
- Access sensitive environment variables and secrets  
- Put the infrastructure at risk  

Preview deployments are powerful, but they must come from trusted contributors with repository write access.
